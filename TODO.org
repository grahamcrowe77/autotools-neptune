* TODO Create tools for generating template repos
** TODO neptune-rel

All app documentation bound together, e.g. kernel, stdlib ..., uranus
* TODO github flow
Why does neptune-ct.at terminate erlang when run on github and still appear to pass?
This works fine locally
* TODO Document build methodology principles
Using new documentation system (XMLs and type/specs)
** TODO Pros/cons of variant build systems
** TODO rebar3, a build, package and distribution management system rolled into one
** TODO Conclusions (build systems and package/distribution management)
** TODO Look into using meson as a build system
** TODO The elusive erlang package management system
* TODO Fix HTML Documentation
** TODO Expand All and Contract All not working as expected
* TODO Fix PDF Documentation
** TODO Fix missing logo from PDF
This doesn't seem to be an issue on other environments, e.g. MacOS. Why?
* TODO Fix distcheck dependency
The distcheck target works when preceded by the targets run in the order:
- 'all'
- 'check'
- 'install' DESTDIR=$PWD/inst
- 'installcheck' DESTDIR=$PWD/inst
- 'dist'
- 'distcheck'
However any change to that order breaks distcheck, e.g. 'all' followed by
'distcheck' implying hidden dependency bug.
