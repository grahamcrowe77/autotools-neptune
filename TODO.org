* TODO Fix edoc
Running edoc works locally but not with the workflow.
This seems to be due to quirks with edoc dependency to
code:lib_dir/1 for returning the path of the application
directory to compile the edoc tags which seems to be unreliable.
Consider using from edoc to html escript (erl_docgen) to
generate htmls for modules
* TODO Fix distcheck dependency
The distcheck target works when preceded by the targets run in the order:
- 'all'
- 'check'
- 'install' DESTDIR=$PWD/inst
- 'installcheck' DESTDIR=$PWD/inst
- 'dist'
- 'distcheck'
However any change to that order breaks distcheck, e.g. 'all' followed by
'distcheck' implying hidden dependency bug.
* TODO Create an Erlang System Release example with GNU Autotools
Using a .rel file to define a release to generate .script and .boot files
and a self contained, minimal, deployable, cross compiled erlang system
* TODO Create automated release workflow
* TODO Complete non-recursive build
