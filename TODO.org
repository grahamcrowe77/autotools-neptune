* DONE Extend example to include a simple NIF
* DONE Add test cases for NIF double_up and square
* TODO Refactor Makefile.am files
Everything works as expected. Make solution more elegant.
* TODO Add a common test example
* TODO Add a documentation example
Demonstrate true power of Autotools portability features
* TODO Refactor configure.ac
** TODO Consistent shell variable usage
** DONE Reduce autotools clutter in top_srcdir
* TODO Explore AT_CHECK_EUNIT autotest macro
This does not seem to work when source modules have embedded eunit tests that
are included with the TEST pre-processor macro, e.g. not possible to
pass/export ERLCFLAGS with -DTEST to compile the code accordingly before
running AT_CHECK_EUNIT. The current workaround is to define specialized M4
macros in tests/local.at
